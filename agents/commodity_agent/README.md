print(f"Volume: {commodity_data.volume:,}")
```

### Sector Impact Analysis
```python
# Analyze sector impacts
sector_impacts = await agent.analyze_sector_impact(commodity_data)
for impact in sector_impacts:
    print(f"{impact.sector}: {impact.impact_type} impact ({impact.impact_score:.3f})")
    print(f"Affected companies: {', '.join(impact.affected_companies)}")
```

### Supply/Demand Analysis
```python
# Analyze supply and demand
supply_demand = await agent.analyze_supply_demand("copper")
print(f"Supply level: {supply_demand.supply_level}")

print(f"Production trend: {supply_demand.production_trend}")
```

### Weather and Geopolitical Monitoring
```python
# Monitor weather impact
weather_impact = await agent.monitor_weather_impact("corn")
print(f"Weather conditions: {weather_impact['weather_conditions']}")
print(f"Production impact: {weather_impact['production_impact']}")

# Monitor geopolitical impact
geo_impact = await agent.analyze_geopolitical_impact("crude_oil")
print(f"Political stability: {geo_impact['political_stability']}")
print(f"Trade risks: {geo_impact['trade_risks']}")
```
