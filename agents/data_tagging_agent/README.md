# Data Tagging Agent

## Overview
The Data Tagging Agent is an intelligent system that tags and categorizes all data by purpose, source, and event type using advanced AI reasoning. The agent indexes data by event time for timeline analysis and determines relevance to trigger other agents when appropriate for comprehensive financial data analysis.

## AI Reasoning Capabilities

### Core AI Functions
1. **Data Categorization & Classification**
   - Uses GPT-4 to categorize data by purpose (research, monitoring, analysis, alert)
   - Identifies data source (SEC, news, social media, financial, regulatory)
   - Classifies event type (filing, announcement, analysis, alert, update)
   - Extracts key entities and relationships

2. **Timeline Indexing & Temporal Analysis**
   - Indexes data by event time for chronological analysis
   - Creates temporal relationships between events
   - Identifies event sequences and causal relationships
   - Builds comprehensive timeline views

3. **Metadata Enrichment**
   - Enriches data with additional metadata and context
   - Adds confidence scores and reasoning for tags
   - Includes source credibility and data quality metrics
   - Creates searchable indexes and relationships

4. **Quality Assessment & Validation**
   - Assesses tagging quality and consistency
   - Validates tag accuracy and completeness
   - Identifies tagging errors and inconsistencies
   - Improves tagging algorithms based on feedback

### Advanced AI Reasoning Functions

#### Data Existence Analysis
- Uses GPT-4 to check if data tags are already in knowledge base
- Compares with existing knowledge base entries for same data
- Determines if new tags add value or are redundant
- Calculates similarity scores based on tag overlap and categorization

#### Intelligent Categorization Selection
- Analyzes data characteristics (type, source, complexity)
- Considers intended use cases and query patterns
- Selects optimal categorization approach:
  - Simple data: Basic purpose/source/event classification
  - Complex data: Multi-level hierarchical categorization
  - Time-sensitive data: Temporal indexing priority
  - Relationship-heavy data: Entity relationship focus

#### Next Action Decision Making
- Analyzes tagging insights for key triggers
- If new data categories detected → trigger relevant specialized agents
- If timeline anomalies → trigger event impact agent
- If data quality issues → trigger validation agents
- If categorization improvements needed → trigger optimization

### MCP Communication & Coordination
- Processes incoming MCP messages with intelligent routing
- Handles urgent requests with priority
- Maintains message processing guarantees
- Coordinates with other agents for verification and analysis

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Implements intelligent recovery strategies based on error type
- Data validation error: Skip and log
- Categorization error: Retry with different approach
- Database error: Retry with connection reset
- API error: Retry with backoff

### Health Monitoring & Optimization
- Calculates health scores based on error rates, tagging accuracy, and data quality
- Tracks performance metrics over time
- Identifies potential issues early
- Adjusts processing frequency based on system load and data availability

## Data Sources
- **SEC Filings**: Regulatory filings and disclosures
- **News Sources**: Financial news and announcements
- **Social Media**: Social media posts and discussions
- **Financial Data**: Market data and financial metrics
- **Regulatory Data**: Government and regulatory information

## Configuration
Set the following environment variables:
- `POSTGRES_USER`: Database username
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `POSTGRES_HOST`: Database host
- `POSTGRES_PORT`: Database port
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
- `ORCHESTRATOR_URL`: Orchestrator MCP endpoint

## Critical System Policy
**NO TRADING DECISIONS**: This agent is STRICTLY for data aggregation, analysis, and knowledge base management. NO TRADING DECISIONS should be made. All analysis is for informational purposes only.

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Implement GPT-4 integration for AI reasoning functions
2. Add real data tagging and categorization integrations
3. Implement MCP communication with orchestrator
4. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Create integration tests for agent coordination
6. Implement data validation and quality checks
7. Add monitoring and alerting capabilities
8. Optimize performance and resource usage
