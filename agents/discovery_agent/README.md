# Discovery Agent

## Overview

The Discovery Agent is an intelligent system designed to generate context-aware market questions continuously and coordinate with other agents to get comprehensive answers. It serves as a blueprint for future cloud integration where an agent can call other agents and ask unique questions 24/7.

## CRITICAL SYSTEM POLICY

**NO TRADING DECISIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS**

This agent only performs:
- Context-aware question generation
- Agent coordination and communication
- Knowledge synthesis and analysis
- Follow-up question generation

**NO trading advice, recommendations, or decisions are provided.**

- **Trend Investigation**: Analyzes trends and generates questions about sustainability
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Identifies missing information and generates questions to fill gaps
- **Context Awareness**: Generates questions based on current market conditions and events

### Agent Coordination and Communication
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Coordinates with multiple agents simultaneously
- **Response Synthesis**: Combines answers from different agents into comprehensive responses
- **Conflict Resolution**: Identifies and resolves conflicting information from different agents
- **Follow-up Generation**: Generates follow-up questions based on agent responses
- **Priority Management**: Manages question priorities and processing order

### Knowledge Synthesis and Analysis

- **Gap Questions**: "What information is missing about this earnings announcement?"
- **Follow-up Questions**: Generated based on initial agent responses

## Configuration

```python
config = {
    "question_generation_interval": 300,  # 5 minutes
    "max_questions_per_cycle": 10,
    "priority_threshold": 5,
    "agent_coordination_timeout": 30,
    "synthesis_confidence_threshold": 0.7
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Question Generation
```python
# Generate context-aware questions
questions = await agent.generate_context_aware_questions()
for question in questions:
    print(f"Question: {question.question_text}")
    print(f"Target agents: {question.target_agents}")
    print(f"Priority: {question.priority}")
```

### Agent Coordination
```python
# Coordinate with agents for comprehensive answer
result = await agent.coordinate_with_agents(question)
print(f"Synthesis: {result.synthesis}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
print(f"Follow-up questions: {len(result.follow_up_questions)}")
```

### Queue Processing
```python
# Process question queue
await agent.process_question_queue()
print(f"Questions in queue: {len(agent.question_queue)}")
print(f"Questions completed: {agent.questions_completed}")
```
