# AI Financial Data Aggregation Agents

This folder contains all intelligent agent microservices. Each agent runs as a separate Docker service with uniform structure and is responsible for specific data ingestion, analysis, or reasoning tasks.

## CRITICAL SYSTEM POLICY

**NO TRADING DECISIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS**

All agents are STRICTLY for data aggregation, analysis, and knowledge base management. NO TRADING ADVICE is provided by any agent.

## Uniform Agent Structure

Every agent follows the same professional structure:

```
agents/agent_name/
├── agent.py          # Main agent logic with AI reasoning and multi-tool integration
├── main.py           # FastAPI server with endpoints and health checks
├── Dockerfile        # Containerized deployment with security enhancements
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies with multi-tool libraries
└── README.md         # Comprehensive documentation
```
