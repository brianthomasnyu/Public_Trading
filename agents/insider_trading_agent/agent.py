NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement GPT-4 integration for AI reasoning functions
2. Add real API integrations for OpenInsider, Finviz, and SEC Form 4
3. Implement MCP communication with orchestrator
4. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Create integration tests for agent coordination
6. Implement data validation and quality checks
7. Add monitoring and alerting capabilities
8. Optimize performance and resource usage

CRITICAL: All implementations must maintain NO TRADING DECISIONS policy.
Focus on data aggregation, analysis, and knowledge base management only.
